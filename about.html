	<div class="about-text"><p>Hi There! My name is Ian Ziatyk, I am 29 years old and I recently moved from New York to Philadelphia. In 2010 I  Co-founded <a href="https://redbridgeproductions.com"> Red Bridge Productions</a>and went on to work on projects for ABC, ESPN and CBS Sports I graduated from  Fordham University in 2014, where I studied Documentary film. Through my work with Red Bridge, I went on to work for Getty Images in New York as a Photo/Video editor.  I love working with computers to create visual images, and am interested in how digital images are presented in the digital world and through my site want to explore how people share and critique images on a higher level.  As a personal project, i want to create an app which encourages photoagrahers to share not only their best images, but contact sheets of entire-shoots, to peer photorahers foor their inpput.  i got the indea in the summer of 2018 when i went to an exhibit of Jaques Lowes photographs of President John F. Kenedy.  Part of Jaques Lowe's Amaxzing story is that he lost nearly all of his photographs in 9/11 when the building he kept his negatives in was destroyed.  The exhibit consisted of contact sheets that were digitally restored and re-printed. n a small aspect of the exhibit existed on a touchscreen computer, where you could look through digital scans of the contact sheets before they were digially restored, complete with original markings and notes from the photograher.  The experience was very intimate and the quality was impressive.  As a tranditionalist photographer who is interested in manual focus, and image qulaity as much as I am with nastalgia, I think that our devices have alot more to offer us in the way of experiencing digital imaging that some of the more popular platforms i.e Instagram are simply lacking  </p>.
